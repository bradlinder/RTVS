# Changelog

## 1.5

- Added integrated "Check for Updates" feature querying GitHub releases with automatic OS binary matching (.exe for Windows, .dmg for macOS, .tar.gz for Linux).
- Non-blocking download and automatic installer execution with safe application shutdown.
- Configurable model download and storage directory in Preferences, with direct link from Manage Models dialog.
- Redesigned Preferences dialog with a clean category tree on the left and settings panels on the right (inspired by Reaper Preferences layout).
- Relocated Language selection to the top-level Settings menu for easier discovery.
- Enhanced speaker label removal logic: removing a speaker label reassigns all audio and segments in that speaker's turn/section to the previous speaker without creating extra speaker labels.
- Streamlined "Change Speaker Label" dialog to only show "Rename All Instances", "Rename This Instance Only", and "Cancel".
- Added dynamic visual mode indicator to Edit/View Transcript button (highlighted active styling and text toggle).
- Optimized GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow: default to Windows builds and automatic release publishing, and fixed macOS arm64 FFmpeg runner compatibility.
